    <h1>Our Holiday in Rome</h1>
    <div id="introduction">
        <p>In April 2023 we took a family holiday to Rome in Italy. It was the first time we had been there and we had a great time.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="travel">
        <h3>Travel</h3>
        <p>There were several stages to getting to our accomodation in central Rome.
            First we travelled by car from our home to Edinburgh Airport. We stayed in the longstay
            carpark which we have used before and find very simple and convenient.
        </p>
        <p>Our flights were with Ryanair and this was the first time we had used them.
            Unfortunately there was a short delay due to strikes in France but otherwise the 
            flight went well.
        </p>
        <p>On arrival at Ciampino Airport we booked a coach to take us into Rome. Our
            accomodation was just a ten minute walk from the bus stop.
        </p>

        <h3>Accomodation</h3>
        <p>We stayed the week in <a href="https://theromehello.com/" target="_blank">The RomeHello Hostel</a> which is located only ten minutes
            walk from Termini Station. We had a family room which had a double bed and 
            bunk beds. The room was clean and comfortable.
        </p>
        <p>The hostel had great facilities including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Kitchen facilities</li>
            <li>A range of entertainment including cookery courses</li>
            <li>Shared common room space</li>
            <li>Buffet breakfast (or breakfast boxes for those with early starts)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="activities">
        <h3>Activities</h3>
        <p>We had planned out our week in advance to make the best use of our 
            time and had prebooked several tours and activities. Here are some of 
            our favourites.
        </p>
        <h5>The Vatican</h5>
        <p>We knew from research that the Vatican can be very busy, particularly in 
            Easter week. Therefore we had booked a tour through Made in Rome tours.
            This proved a great benefit as we were able to skip long queues and also 
            were directed to the most significant parts of the vast museums. Seeing inside
             St Peter's Basilica was very interesting.
        </p>
        <h5>Colosseum</h5>
        <p>The Colosseum was the thing my son had most wanted to visit. It was very busy
             but we enjoyed seeing inside such an ancient building. We had audio visual 
             guides which were helpful in explaining what we were seeing.
        </p>
        <h5>Stadio Domiziano</h5>
        <p>This is a less well know museum underneath Plaza Navona. It shows how the Plaza 
            was once an athletics stadium and some of the original stadium has been excavated. 
            My daughter particularly enjoyed the children's audio tour as it was entertaining 
            for her age group.
        </p>

        <h3>Food and Drink</h3>
        <p>Rome is, of course, famous for food and drink and we tried to sample a range 
            including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pizza</li>
            <li>Lemoncello</li>
            <li>Carbonara</li>
            <li>Suppli</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We were fortunate to attend two cooking classes in the hostel where we 
            learned how to make carbonara and pizza. We joined in with cooking it and then
            ate the results. This was great fun and made a change from going out.
        </p>
        <p>I loved trying new things, particularly suppli which are balls of fried rice 
            filled with melted cheese - delicious!
